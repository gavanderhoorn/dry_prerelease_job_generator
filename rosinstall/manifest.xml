  <description brief="rosinstall">
rosinstall is a tool to check out ROS source code (or any source code, really) from multiple version control repositories and updating these checkouts. Given a *.rosinstall file that specifies where to get code, rosinstall will check out a working copy for you. We recommend the use of rosinstall when checking out development versions of ROS source code. This package is where the code lives, however it is not expected for users to checkout and use this package directly.  It is expected that users use the version available through pypi.python.org.
